## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- PyTorch ~1.7.1
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Datasets

### MS-COCO and Flickr30K
We follow [SCAN](https://github.com/kuanghuei/SCAN) to obtain image features and vocabularies.

### CC152K
We use a subset of [Conceptual Captions](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions) (CC), named CC152K. CC152K contains training 150,000 samples from the CC training split, 1,000 validation samples and 1,000 testing samples from the CC validation split. We follow the pre-processing step in [SCAN](https://github.com/kuanghuei/SCAN) to obtain the image features and vocabularies.
